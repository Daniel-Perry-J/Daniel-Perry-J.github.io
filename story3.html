    <p>After I had taken in the sights at the beach, I began travel back the way I came from.</p>
    <p>I still wanted more adventure though so I went to the Fairhaven Park.</p>
    <p>The walk there was much longer than I had originally thought.</p>
    <p>When I got to the park I walked down a trail that had a river running by.</p>
    <p>The sound of rushing water on those smooth stones was like music to my ears</p>
    <p>As I continued along the path I decided that was time to go home after a long day of walking around.</p>
