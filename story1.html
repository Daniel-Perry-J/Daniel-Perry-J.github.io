    <p>One day I was out on a walk</p>
    <p>I did not have any idea of a destination in mind</p>
    <p>I walked through the arboretum at Sehome hill</p>
    <p>As I exited, I kept on walking eventfully ending up in downtown Bellingham</p>
    <p>Because the weather was nice I decide to walk down to the beach.</p>
    <p>Along the way I traveled through town</p>
    <p>There were a lot of people out enjoying the nice weather</p>
    <p>Finally, I made it down to the beach.</p>
    <p>I located some pretty glass shards at the beach</p>
